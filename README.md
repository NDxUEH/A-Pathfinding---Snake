# A-Pathfinding---Snake

This is my mini project in AI course. I used A star pathfinding algorithm to make my snake automate to find path to fruit. This code is inspired by https://github.com/microStationCorp/intell_snake/blob/master/intel_snake.py, I've changed code to apply to my work and get desired result!!
